# AG Christmas Bech Volley Tournament 2025 — Event Webpage

Files:
- index.html — main webpage (hero, about, schedule, teams, registration, venue)
- styles.css — responsive styles
- script.js — countdown, form handling, smooth scroll
- README.md — this file

How to use:
1. Place the files in a folder on your web server or open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Customize event details (dates, venue, contact) directly in `index.html`.
3. To connect registration to a backend, replace the simulated submit in `script.js` with a `fetch()` POST to your server endpoint.

Accessibility & SEO notes:
- The page includes semantic markup (header/main/section/footer), ARIA attributes where helpful, and an accessible skip link.
- Update meta description and title to reflect your final event copy for better search results.

Want me to:
- Add a real map embed (Google Maps) or directions link?
- Wire registration to a simple Firebase/Netlify function for form submissions?
- Create printable schedule/fixture PDF export?

Tell me which you prefer and I’ll update the files.
